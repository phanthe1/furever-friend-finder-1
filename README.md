## How to connect to the SQL database
Navigate to the root of your project on your local machine and create a file called .env. That's right, no name, just the extension. This will be a text file we keep our secrets in.

Inside that file, we write down our secrets in the following fashion:
```
DBHOST=sql3.freesqldatabase.com
DBUSER=sql3523753             
DBPW=J1EtV8wIeq
DB=sql3523753
```
